bookbot for bootdev
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

USAGE: python3 main.py <filepath>
Accepts CLI input with 1 argument, for filepath of book to be assessed. Prints a report to the command line with: the name of the filepath being assessed, the count of words in the text file, and the count of each alphabetical character within the text file.
